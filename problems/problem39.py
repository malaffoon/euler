"""Problem 39 - Project Euler

Integer right triangles

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c},
there are exactly three solutions for p = 120:

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

Optimizations (it took about 30 seconds without any optimizations):
 * p has to be even (try combinations of odd/even a,b and this falls out)
 * given a,p and the two equations a**2+b**2=c**2, a+b+c=p, then you can solve for b
