# Project Euler - Go

This is my first foray into Go. Wish me luck.

NOTE: I started Project Euler with Python. As such, many of my thoughts are captured in those files.
When solving the problems in Rust, Go, and other languages, i just copied the approach from Python
without much comment. So, if you don't understand something in Go, look for the Python solution.
