"""Problem 233 - Project Euler

Lattice points on a circle

Let f(N) be the number of points with integer coordinates that are on a circle
passing through (0,0), (N,0), (0,N), and (N,N).

It can be shown that f(10000) = 36.

What is the sum of all positive integers N â‰¤ 10^11 such that f(N) = 420 ?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Equation of circle is: (x - N/2)^2 + (y - N/2)^2 = N^2 / 2

Number theory says the number of integer solutions of x^2 + y^2 = k can be calculated.
Prime factorization, k = 2 x p1^f1 x p2^f2 x ... x q1^h1 x q2^h2 x ..., where p is 1mod4 and q is 3mod4.
Then r(k) = 4 x (f1+1) x (f2+1)...; if all h are even, else r(k) = 0.

We want r(k) = 420 -> (f1+1)x(f2+1)x(f3+1) = 105
There are only a few ways to do that: 3x5x7, 7x15, 5x21, 3x35, 105.
Combine p's with f's as (2,4,6),(6,14),(4,20),(2,34),(104).
Since the smallest p is 5, the last two combinations can be eliminated, 5^34 > 1e23.
And k ~ N*N, use square root, so we want p's with f's as (1,2,3),(3,7),(2,10).
And we can multiply by any number without a prime factor p until we hit N.

p's: 5,13,17,29,37,41,53,61,73,89,97,...
